# Python_1
BCS Python #1
This is a manadatory requirement to the BCS Python assignment. It serves no purpose other than to fulfil and re-iterate the requirements of the assignment.
Without the use of the Pandas libraries, two csv files were to be imported and digested for such items but not exclusive to; number of months, sum of income, monthly income and max and min deltas. 
While not necessary, if this readme is required for grading a proforma or a standardised template should have been made available as it is known that each company and many federal departments have their own logging, documentation and compliance specifications. Thus if this is to replicate proper industry-like standards for documentation a standard must be demonstrated before critiquing students.
